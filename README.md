# Build-an-image-labels-generator-using-Amazon-Rekognition

Overview of Project :

In this project, I have build an image labels generator, using Amazon Rekognition. This is going to be a fun one. Once built, it will be able to recognize and label images. For example, if you have a photo of a cat, Amazon Recognition will be able to identify what it is, and label the image as a cat.

Steps to be performed:

I will  be going through the following steps.

Creating an Amazon S3 Bucket
Uploading images to the S3 Bucket
Installing configuring the AWS Command line interface (CLI)
Importing libraries
Adding detect_labels function
Adding main function
Running your python file

Services I Used :

Amazon S3: For storing the images in the process of generating labels.
Amazon Rekognition: To analyse images and generate image labels.
AWS CLI: Interacting with AWS services through command line interface(CLI).

Estimated Time & Cost :
This project is estimated to take about 20-30 minutes
Cost: Free
